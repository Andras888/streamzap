##Streamzap
Getting the [Streamzap USB remote](http://www.streamzap.com/consumer/pc_remote/index.php) to work under Linux is currently trivial and does NOT require the use of [LIRC](http://www.lirc.org) any more, although LIRC does provide the ability to map the same keypress to different actions under a variety of applications.

The repo contains several config files that work with [v4l-utils](http://git.linuxtv.org/v4l-utils.git) and any modern Linux kernel as well as files to allow operation with LIRC, specifically for mythtv, xbmc, and mplayer.


## Option #2 - Basic operation of mplayer using only the v4l-utils package.
* Install the v4l-util package (your distro provides this in all likelyhood).
* Modify /etc/rc_maps.cfg so the streamzap line points to /etc/rc_keymaps/streamzap.local

### Supplemental Info
#### Syntax of /etc/rc_keymaps/streamzap.local
The syntax of the keymap `scancode button_name`

#### Show Available Scancodes
Execute `ir-keytable` without any arguments.  Example:
```
# ir-keytable
Found /sys/class/rc/rc0/ (/dev/input/event3) with:
	Driver streamzap, table rc-streamzap
	Supported protocols: NEC RC-5 RC-6 JVC SONY SANYO LIRC RC-5-SZ other
	Enabled protocols: RC-5-SZ
	Name: Streamzap PC Remote Infrared Rec
	bus: 3, vendor/product: 0e9c:0000, version: 0x0100
	Repeat delay = 500 ms, repeat period = 125 ms
```

Execute `ir-keytable --read --device=/dev/input/PATH` where PATH is what the previous command outputted (event3 in the example above).

#### Show Availble Button Names
The lrc-utils package is likely required.  Execute `irrecord -l` to see a list of all available button names.
